This project includes my final discrete mathematics project.
This project is mainly associated with graph theory.

My project is about friendship graph and it's different operations and concepts.

## Technologies used
- Python
- Networkx
- Matplotlib
- VScode
- Git
- Git-hub

## Parts

### source folder (src)
- build_graph_freinds
- in_out_degree
- Dijkstra algorithm
- BFS_DFS algorithms
- connected_components
- centerality
- json file (friendship.json)

### report

Here I created a report PDF in which I try to include mathematical concepts, and other informations and implementation describtion.

### input-output

In this part I try to test my implementations and put inputs and outputs together.

**I'll be thankful if you star my work wether you find it useful.**
